## Position History at GlobalTech Corporation

### April 2015 - March 2018: Machine Learning Engineer
Mr. Tanaka joined the AI Platform Division as a Machine Learning Engineer. During this period, he was responsible for developing core components of GlobalTech's proprietary AutoML pipeline (version 1), including data preprocessing modules and feature engineering frameworks. He worked closely with multiple product teams to integrate ML models into our production SaaS applications. His contributions were instrumental in establishing the technical foundation of our AutoML platform.

### April 2018 - March 2021: Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Individual Contributor)
Following his promotion, Mr. Tanaka led the development of GlobalTech AutoML version 2, which achieved a 40% improvement in model training efficiency. He designed our proprietary distributed training architecture and implemented the company's internal model evaluation and A/B testing framework. During this period, he mentored 2 junior engineers and received the GlobalTech Innovation Award in 2020 for his contributions to the AutoML v2 platform.

### April 2021 - Present: Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Team Lead)
Mr. Tanaka was promoted to team lead in recognition of his technical expertise and leadership abilities. He currently oversees a team of 4 ML engineers responsible for developing GlobalTech AutoML version 3 and the next-generation data pipeline infrastructure. His responsibilities include:

- Managing the ML infrastructure budget (approximately JPY 50 million annually)
- Coordinating cross-border ML model deployment between Japan and U.S. operations
- Leading the migration of the AutoML platform to GlobalTech's proprietary cloud infrastructure
- Training engineers across the Tokyo and Osaka offices on the AutoML system (12 engineers trained to date)
- Liaising with the U.S. subsidiary (GlobalTech Solutions Inc.) on technical integration projects

Mr. Tanaka was ranked 2nd among 45 engineers in the AI Platform Division during the FY2024 annual performance review.

## Specialized Knowledge

Mr. Tanaka possesses deep specialized knowledge of GlobalTech's proprietary technologies that has been developed through his 10+ years of continuous employment:

1. **GlobalTech AutoML Platform (v1, v2, v3)**: Mr. Tanaka is one of the original architects of our AutoML platform and has contributed to all three major versions. He has intimate knowledge of the platform's internal architecture, optimization algorithms, and deployment procedures that are trade secrets of GlobalTech Corporation.

2. **Internal Data Pipeline Infrastructure**: Mr. Tanaka designed key components of our data pipeline system that processes over 2TB of data daily. This infrastructure uses proprietary algorithms for data transformation and optimization that are not available in any commercial or open-source product.

3. **Cross-Border Deployment Expertise**: Having worked extensively with our U.S. subsidiary, Mr. Tanaka understands the technical requirements for deploying ML models across GlobalTech's multi-region infrastructure, including data residency compliance and performance optimization.

4. **Training and Knowledge Transfer**: Mr. Tanaka has trained 12 engineers on our proprietary AutoML system and development workflows. His ability to transfer this specialized knowledge is essential for the U.S. subsidiary's operations.

## Confirmation

I confirm that Mr. Tanaka is a valued employee of GlobalTech Corporation in good standing. His proposed transfer to GlobalTech Solutions Inc. in Los Angeles, California is fully supported by the company. Upon completion of his temporary assignment in the United States, Mr. Tanaka will return to Japan to resume his employment with GlobalTech Corporation.
